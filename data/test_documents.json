        "lyrics": "You get a shiver in the dark\nIt's raining in the park, but meantime\nSouth of the river, you stop, and you hold everything\nA band is blowing Dixie, double-four time\nYou feel alright when you hear the music ring\n\nWell, now you step inside\nBut you don't see too many faces\nComing in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down\nCompetition in other places\nAh, but the horns, they're blowing that sound\nWay on down south\nWay on down south, London town\n\nCheck out guitar George\nHe knows all the chords\nMind, it's strictly rhythm\nHe doesn't wanna make it cry or sing\nYes and an old guitar is all he can afford\nWhen he gets up under the lights to play his thing\n\nAnd Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene\nHe's got a daytime job, he's doing alright\nHe can play the honky tonk like anything\nSaving it up for Friday night\nWith the Sultans\nWith the Sultans of Swing\nYeah\n\nAnd a crowd of young boys\nThey're fooling around in the corner\nDrunk and dressed in their best brown baggies\nAnd their platform soles\nThey don't give a damn\nAbout any trumpet-playing band\nIt ain't what they call \"Rock and Roll\"\nAnd the Sultans\nYeah, the Sultans, they play Creole\nCreole\n\nAnd then the man, he steps right up to the microphone\nAnd says at last, just as the time bell rings\n\"Goodnight, now it's time to go home\"\nThen he makes it fast with one more thing\n\"We are the Sultansâ€”\nWe are the Sultans of Swing\""
